Increases in your contributions now could have a big payoff later on. Avoid dipping into your retirement savings to fund present expenses or splurges and make sure retirement is taken care of before funding a child’s college education (there are no loans for retirement!).</p>

You can save this over time by making automatic contributions from your paychecks.<br /><br /><b>In your 30s</b><br />Once family, home ownership, and other factors come into play, it makes sense to create more of a financial cushion in case of emergency. Try to increase your savings in this category over time.<br /><br /><b>In your 40s</b><br />Emergencies can happen at any time, but as you get a little older, you should think about the prospect of potential health issues or other types of unexpected expenses you may not have anticipated. Make sure your total emergency fund increases in line with your current income, which will likely go up after your 20s or 30s.</p>

                          Be careful about refinancing student loans since you could lose access to forgiveness and repayment options. Once one loan or debt is paid off, add the monthly payment to another debt to reduce overall debt faster. Understand that there is good debt (student loans, mortgage, etc.) and bad debt (auto loans, credit cards, etc.).
